Delivery
After the buyer bought the vehicle from our website, two options of delivery will be offered. Buyer can drive to the dealer to pick up the vehicle, or he can use our insured and convenient delivery services. If the buyer chooses to pick up the vehicle, he will complete the paper work and pay the vehicle price in full excluding the deposit when he arrives in the dealer’s. Buyer may have a test drive with the car, but he can’t retract the purchasing agreement consented on our website. In the worst case, if the buyer persists that he can’t purchase the car, the buyer will be charged a penalty no more than 5 % of the final price.
The vehicle delivery services we provide on our website are offered by two partner: the Nittany Auto Delivery, and Tennis Auto Delivery. Both our partners have strongly skilled drivers with sales skills, and their offices are located all over the country. If a buyer choose to get the vehicle via one of the delivery partners, he can expect the vehicle at his door after 3-7 business days upon clear payments. The charges of the delivery will be determined on the distance between the two destination and the type of the vehicle. The optional insurance on the auto delivery will be offered at buyer’s expense. At the time when the car is delivered to the buyer, buyer will complete the payments as well as paperwork with the trusted driver from our partners.
